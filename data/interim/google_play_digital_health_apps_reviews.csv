Not just what your symptoms are but for how long its been bothering you, the intensity of it, asks about specific things that aggravate it or relieves symptoms etc. Only thing they didn't have is to ask about my medical history relevant to my symptoms.

I've since learned the way around the app and I wouldn't have any other platform. Now that I have mastered the log in information the app works better. I do a lot of video chats and there are times that I either can't hear or we loose the connections. Most times we only talk for about 30 minutes. The remaining time is spent reconnecting.,5,216,5.9.0,2024-03-17 15:22:39,,,5.9.0,com.mdlive.mobile,MDLIVE: Talk to a Doctor 24/7,2024,3,2024-03,407,Positive

It works really well, especially for symptom tracking. That's one of the highlights. I do, however, have a thing that might be good to change. Some treatments should be ""as needed"" and they're not. I'm selectively mute and I sometimes won't need an AAC device for the whole day, but the only way to put it in my treatment plan is to do it every day or something for a set amount of time. Some of those things being ""as needed"" would be great. Otherwise it's amazing!",5,104,2.0.7,2023-11-13 10:16:50,"Hi Jane, thanks for taking the time to provide us with your feedback!
