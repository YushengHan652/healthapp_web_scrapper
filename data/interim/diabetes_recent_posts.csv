i know the old joke is that when they send you lancets with diabetes supplies they send you a lifetime supply every time, but i thought i'd challenge myself to change it every time this month (and half of last month) and, yeah, it hurts a lot less and is often easier to get blood. So, that's a pro on the list.

A con would be adding additional tasks to the list of things you have to do daily as a diabetic can be a bad idea, bc it can lead to burnout. i know for a lot of t2s with good management, this is why their doctors will sometimes recommend not checking blood sugar as often. and i know for t1s and other diabetics on insulin, there's already way too many tasks to do every day, decisions to make, that adding another could lead to a burnout crash. 

so...i get why the meme is there and why a lot of people don't change it every time.

Limiting carbs to once a day (I typically have toast for breakfast), I allow myself a sugary treat once or twice a week just to help take the extreme cravings away (I'm talking like a single cookie or something), and yet I'm still getting high readings. 

For example, tonight my sugar was 177 about 2 and half hours after eating dinner. When I look at what I ate today, I don't get it.

I did have a Propel packet, but it was 0 sugar, 0 carbs, so that shouldn't hit me...right?

Am i nuts for being so concerned about having a reading above 150? I feel like if I'm not starving myself and feeling super hungry all day, then I'm not going to get a good reading.

They sent me a message the next day saying my A1C was at 6.5%. I had another blood test scheduled on Saturday (from my doctor wanting to do a full workup as part of a checkup). After a stressful few days, I just found out that on this one the A1C came out to 5.2%! My estimated glucose on Saturday was at 103 (fasting) and measured 94 (fasting) last November.

It's been a stressful few days, and the scare definitely had me cutting out the snacks and eating ""right"". I wasn't eating terribly in terms of meals, but I definitely had way too many snacks. Probably had too many cookies the night before the Wednesday test. 😬However that's supposed to be too short term to matter as much for A1C, right?

It's just very peculiar to me. I've sent a message to my doctor to see what she recommends as the next steps. I'm guessing we might do a third test just to see if we can definitively rule that other one out as a wonky result. I wonder if people here have seen anything similar? I looked up reasons for false high results, and mainly I found anemia. But I've had many yearly blood tests because of another chronic condition, and my hematocrit and ferritin levels have always been great.

Some background on me: I'm 49 years old and had a 6.1% reading in March 2023. After that, I started a weight loss program (through that study I mentioned) and have dropped about 55-60 pounds. All with strictly following a diet and not much change in activity. I'm pretty much down to the size I'd be targeting, though I still want to work on my build to add a higher muscle percentage. I've been eating pretty well (much lower carbs, much higher vegetable and lean meat), though the snacks are my achilles heel. Once I got my weight down I still regularly indulge as long as my weight isn't going back up. If I'd kept going the way I was before, I wouldn't have been surprised to hit the 6.5% mark like I did.

To all the women thinking they'll die childless and young because that's what their endos are telling them to guilt trip them into better control. I see you. I feel you. I was one of you.

I am writing this post because I want to try to convince you to save up for an insulin pump. I resisted getting an insulin pump for a long, long, long time, because I thought the concept of renouncing the autonomy of deciding my own insulin boluses when I was already in the put of burning out and nihilistic depression was cripplingly terrifying. I was also afraid the insulin pump itself being always attached to my body would be a physical reminder of my disease 24/7, which in my burnt out depressed state of being was the very last thing I needed, not to mention the impact it would have on my dating life. I was afraid because I heard stories of people's pumps malfunctioning and sending them into diabetic comas and nobody finding them because they live alone by themselves in a foreign country. I am that person. I was scared shitless and for 5 years preferred a HbA1c of 10 over that.

But it's not that bad. The insulin pump has a lot of safeguards in place to keep you safe. You have an app that gives your mum or dad an alert on their phone in case you have a hypo, so even from their country abroad they can call an ambulance if stuff goes bad. People will still love you, cherish you and want to date you. Most importantly?

You'll have the chance to forget you have diabetes without hurting yourself. For a whole half day, even longer, you can just... let go. Not care. Not check. Breathe. After the first month of having the pump, those anxieties you held deeply in your heart? They will start to melt away. The doctors won't shout at you anymore. People won't guilt trip you with pictures of rotting toes anymore. If you're a woman, you'll be able to have children without being afraid anymore.

This isn't a post for all of the amazing diabetics with fantastic control that keep their shit together and have great bloodwork and aren't relating to any of the above. You guys are doing great as well. But I know that there is a sea of young adults who lurk this sub and sometimes leave a post or two about how utterly hopeless they are because their sugars are in the shitter, and I just want to tell them: there is a hope. It's not a full cure, but. It's a lot closer to it than what you're doing now.

Overall I was not a very sporty individual however I also had a very well-balanced diet and had healthy lifestyles however during december 2024 I had a trip to Veracruz, Mexico with my grandparents and uncles on which I started not only taking a new medicine (Risperidona) which affects sugar levels sometimes but I also let go of my healthy diet and started drinking bottled juice, soda and overall very sugary stuff I started feeling weird, I had trouble going t the bathroom and would sleep for longer periods at a time than usual I thought that it was  just part of the adolescense and after christmas when I returned to Puebla city to my regular scheule with my parents things went much smoother and I started feeling great again, however for Reyes I went to Cancun with my other Uncles and Cousins and there was when I started feeling like crap, again with no digestion, however I kept enjoying with my uncles thinking I was just with intestinal congestion or something like that, however on day 2 of my trip we went to a mall on which I started to feel my saliva was really just not there, and I was very tired, I thought I was just dehydrated so I bought some apple juice (awful choice) and after feeling worse drank some sugar-free electrolytes (coincidence). Things just worsened and when we rented a padel course I could just not play feeling unpowered, the 5 days that followed I was moving from couch to couch sleeping a lot, going to the bathroom to urinate a lot and drinking a lot of water, just standing up would give me a great heart beat and make me very tired. That day my Uncle was sad bc she wanted me to enjoy our trip, and so she took me to the cinema where I drank Coke, then we went to eat Maracuya Fish and topped everything off with a bread-based dinner, I noticed my sight was blurry and I felt dizzy. that night i started uncontrolably vomiting, and the next day she took me to a gastroenterologist however fortunately for me, I was attended by an endocrinologist inestead thanks to the universe alligning for me haha, however he immediately noticed I was tired and overventilating so he took a quick blood test that turned out to be 444 (mg/dl) of blood sugar, he told my uncles that we needed to rush to the hospital and that he would meet us there, I just remember my uncle handling the situation calmly and attentively. Once we arrived there she called my parents telling them the grave situation and asking them for a set of legal documents, as she could not get me into the ER without an authorization sheet from my parents, so we got all setup and after around an hour of waiting I was admitted onto the ER where I spent 3 hours getting tests and needles n my veins (I hate needles) after all drama my sugar spiked to a stagering 508(mg/dl) with ketoacidosis I was very confused and can't really make a chronological order of events from there barely remembering some things that happened, I was taken to an intense care unit where I remember I hated not being able to stand up, eat or go to the bathroom in anything but a jug, I just also happen to remember how much I hated when every hour someone would come to manually take my sugar. I recall waking up the bed next day so i turned on the TV and watched some documentaries to spend time, at around that period of time they applied a sensor, more specifically the Libre Freestyle from Abott and it was such a relief!. My parents arriven around that timestamp but they would not allow them to see me until I was on a regular room. the last few hours were particularly stresfull as my cousins would return to Puebla, and I heard the person 2 beds away had coded. When I finally came out of intense care I could see my parents and Uncles and was glad to do so, I spent the next 2 days on a regular room waiting to stabilize, I watched the Show ""The Money"" on Apple TV and enjoyed finally being able to eat!, but hated the Insulin injections (still getting used to it), then I flew back to Puebla! and enjoyed home sweet home and some christmas gifts my parents got me!

I was vegetarian then.
For a year I've tried to reverse insulin resistance. I change diet, I started to exercise more, but it was getting worse over the time. 
My endo told me there's high chance I have type 1 diabetes, (since my sister suffers from it too). They took me to hospital and for now I have to inject long-acting insulin (sometimes I use fast-acting too, because sometimes my sugar is high even after low carb meal, but only sometimes - usually I don't need it). I wouldn't be able to healing diabetes by medicines. But pancreas antibody test results were negative. My endo said that it can be still developing type 1 or mody diabetes. He said if my condition doesn't get worse, he will do tests for mody diabetes. I don't think it's mody - it is dominative gene and I have no diabetes in my family except my sister and one of my relatives which was also type 1.
When I was going through influenza, I had low D vitamine level and I was really stressed, which, as I know, are one of the causes of t1 diabetes. But I have no antibodies? If its type 2, then why it didnt reverse despite the activity and healthy diet? Did I even have influence to developing of disease?

The first measurement I make is usually around 110, but then if I make a second measurement shortly after it's usually around 100, sometimes lower. This happens consistently and I'm very confused

In my mind a glucose of ~110 is a much bigger problem than one of ~100, so I'm not sure what to think

I tested the glucometer with the test solution and it seems to be working correctly, so the variation really comes from me. Could sweat be affecting the results? I try to have my hands as dry as possible but I can't stop cells from releasing sweat while I'm getting the blood

One day I made several measurements spaced out by some 20 or 30 minutes and they went: 117, 107, 98, 102, 100

Bit of back story -
My dad is 69 yrs old and been diabetic patient for long time. He lives in India and I am in Nj. 

Since past 7-8 years his ha1c is consistently high and likely never went under 10. He is on insulin and meds and these readings are with high does of insulin. He takes 7units morning and evening and one 14 long lasting insulin and metformin along with it.  Total 28 units. 
He's saying he take regular meds and I want to believe his food habits aren't crazy (which I seriously doubt now) - vegetarian and balanced home food- includes salad and some seasonal fruit etc. for most part. I think something is not adding up, my suspicion is that he is sneaking food without telling anyone but that's just a guess. 

He has seen a few diabetetians but most Drs suggested bit higher does and shuffle insulin type. He has suffered ketoacidosis at least once a year and admitted to hospital in critical conditions.

Fast forward to now - he is going to be visiting me for few months, so I am looking for some advice. What could I do to work on lowering his sugar?
Any recommendations on Dr (it'd be helpful if in NJ), tests and to figure out the cause of such a high readings.

If you have questions, feel free... 

The only time I've ever been to jail, I was allowed to keep my pump, CGM, and my contact lenses, but they made me stay alone in a tiny cell in the intake area in the basement, with nothing in it, and I wasn't allowed out for 6 full days except once for a 10 minute shower about 3 days in (which has a gross side story in itself)...It also had no lights. I'm pretty sure it was a solitary cell for suicidal people. Probably wasn't ethical for them to not let me out at all, but oh well, got to keep the pump and cgm and contact lenses. They don't let you bring anything whatsoever into the actual populated jail other than glasses. There were 2 other people in similar solitary cells. One was a girl in her early 20's who was mentally handicapped, talked to herself nonstop, and didn't understand what was going on. The other was an elderly man who had Schizophrenia. They both did not wear any clothes and seemed suicidal and unstable, and thought I was various different relatives of theirs... 

The nurse was a SUPER friendly and intelligent lady who would check in on me to make sure everything was alright, and forced the guards to let me use my tester and supplies a few times per day. The guards themselves, would absolutely not have bothered with it if the nurse hadn't forced them to do it. 

Hands down, the most boring experience I've had in entire lifetime. The 1 week definitely felt like a month or 2...Interesting sidenotes, almost all of the guards both male and female were either REALLY creepy or REALLY stupid, or both. It isn't like the jail TV shows, and 90% of them were not at all even remotely normal people. Has to be one of the worst jobs you can have... They are essentially locked in the jail just like an inmate, but paid...The guards were legitimately bad people. I can go into detail if wanted, but legit not good people. I thought all of the food was ""decent to good"". People who are crazy or suicidal have to wear ""pickle suits"" and helmets. 95% of the people I saw go through intake were drug addicts, and a surprising amount of elderly people came through. There were also 100% for sure people in the jail because they were mentally handicapped and had no support system or family, which isn't super surprising but definitely bothered me. 

I was told by the staff if you are an ""actual criminal"", have a violent history, or are going to be there for a long time, it's not allowed in the jail populated area. I had the book thrown at me for a stupid situation that did not negatively impact anyone, and probably shouldn't have been there, so they didn't take my things, and I think they cut me a break, medically speaking. They actually had me set up and buy all my supplies and meds with the jail pharmacy beforehand, and they locked it all in a safe in the nurse's office. You aren't allowed to ""carry in"" any supplies or meds with you when turning yourself over to the jail and being inventoried. FYI. 

All that being said, I guarantee if I'd had to have been there longer than the week I was there, or hadn't had help from lawyer and endocrinologist, they would not have allowed me to keep it...the standard policy is ""Eyeglasses are the only thing allowed. "" They did not allow me to take in the books I brought, and I lied and said I didn't have contact lenses, but the nurse later gave me a case and solution after she met me, and the guards let me keep them, due to the nurse demanding it. She later on, literally told me inmates will dip their contact lenses into liquid LSD, smuggle it into the jail on their eyeballs, immediately sell them out, cut the lenses into quarters, and they all eat them in the holding area. Dead serious.

2 people in the population area died in the 1 week I was there, and other weird things happened that I didn't describe because they aren't really T1 related topics and are somewhat disturbing, but I can if people want. Overall, I definitely would not recommend.",Type 1,False

I started swimming laps at the rec center three days a week before work and despite the spikes after it has helped so much. 
I do wonder how to burn fat though. I am not overweight (6’4, 170lbs) but I was seriously thin before my diagnosis/treatment (135lbs). 

Any advice? It’s of course my belly fat that is the most noticeable. I’ve never had to try to manage my bodyweight before and this stupid disease is throwing all kinds of curveballs my way. TIA!

For context, I’m a female & 25 years old, I got diagnosed when I was 19 with type one diabetes. 

I remember being in the ICU for 6 days & super excited to get out. The worst part of being in the ICU was probably when the nurse came in to educate me on how to give myself insulin at home & my mom was with me. My mom asked the nurse “how long will she need to take this medication, when can she stop?” Needless to say, my mother is a sweetheart & the nurse started crying. It was really rough having to hear that, but here I am 6 years later- living & loving life! 

It wasn’t always living & loving though. My first year was rough. I was always angry & super sad. Slowly that changed & I realized if I didn’t set high expectations for myself, I’d completely lose me. 

I still eat whatever it is I want (chips are my favourite lol,) & I don’t feel bad about it or let anyone else make me feel ways either. 

I guess to anyone who is struggling or newly diagnosed I just want to say, you’re gonna be fine❤️Type one may be a daily struggle, but you’ve got this!! There are days that’ll be super draining & you’ll feel that the world is against you- but YOU’VE GOT THIS!!❤️❤️❤️ 

6 years ago I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. 6 years later, I’m about to be a certified teacher, & things in life don’t seem all that bad. 

Anyways, that’s all🫶🏻

After my diagnosis, I changed my diet and it was considered controlled within 3 months (3 mth post diagnosis I went from 8.1 to 5.9 a1c). But I nearly any carb (even things like lentils and oats) would spike my sugar levels. And I’m not a vegetarian but I don’t love meat, so it was a struggle. Which is why I went on ozempic, I was hoping it would give me more flexibility (which it did).

Ive lost 60ish pounds since starting ozempic. In addition, I’ve had knee problems since I was a child and had my knee replaced last year. This has greatly improved my mobility. And now that the nice weather is here I’ve been taking my dogs for leisurely 2 miles walks most days. This is in addition to strength training I do 2-3 times/week (it’s nothing crazy).

However now I’ve been struggling with low sugar levels at night that sets off my cgm alarms multiple times a night. I even have a scoop of ice cream at night and still get that lows.

Now there's gotta be a LOT of sugar in those. And even when I stopped bolusng for the tonic water (same carb count as a regular coke, which surprised some people) I STILL drop. 

Tonight, between 9:30pm and 1am, I had 4 double vodka tonics. At 12:50, I was 17.0 and double arrows spiking. Incredibly unexpected. Control IQ on my tslim X2 was trying but still couldn't get it down. So when I ordered my fourth drink, I bolused for 30g (what would've been in the tonic water)

Now at 2am, I'm 2.8 and dropping. Less than an hour ago, I was 12.2. 

Why is it SO unpredictable? How do I plan for this?? I'm so in the dark here, and as I'm sure y'all know, being drunk AND low is an absolute nightmare.

My body doesn’t produce insulin, so I need insulin pumping in me.

I ran out of insulin and I can’t afford new one because of health care issues. My blood sugar has been all types of messed up and it’s been going from super high to super low very quickly.

I’m getting dizziness, I can’t eat anything without throwing up. I just can’t function at all.

Getting constant cramps, going unconscious and I’m feeling worse by the day. 

Went to the hospital and they gave me iv and insulin and stuff but I’m back the same. I probably need to see someone more in dept with this but can’t afford it.

1jr1ztl,My initial A1C results might have been faulty and it's driving me nuts.,2,0.75,2025-04-03 23:08:23,IslandFearless2925,8,/r/diabetes/comments/1jr1ztl/my_initial_a1c_results_might_have_been_faulty_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1jr1ztl/my_initial_a1c_results_might_have_been_faulty_and/,True,"Short version of an incredibly long story: About a year ago I had an AWFUL cellulitis infection and 360+ blood sugar. A few days later (and a couple of antibiotics) my sugars had dropped to 130. They measured my A1C at 11.5 the same day.

45 days later my A1C was 6.2.

Three months after that, my A1C was 5.2.

During my last checkup, the same doctor who measured my A1C told me the initial test might have been faulty, or the infection might have skewed the results. She's referring me to another endocrinologist for a second opinion.

I'm not trying to look for zebras in a horse pasture. There is a 99.99% chance I'm Type 2. I have risk factors, a family history of diabetes and all kinds of pancreatic fuckery, so I accepted it outright. I was actually kind of proud of myself, because from those results it looked like I was kicking diabetes in its butt. Now, things aren't so concrete. And I HAVE to know going forward for my medical map.

More doctors. More tests. More money. More time.

I accept that I'm diabetic. No one wants diabetes, fucking of course not. I accept it. I've gone through the grieving process, and I've accepted it. And I'm still going to live like I am a diabetic, there's no reason not to. I'm stronger than I was a year ago, my diet is better, my weight is better... I'm living better.  
  
But dammit, I want a concrete answer. 10 years ago a whole other situation happened to me where I had either a full misdiagnosis or a medical fucking miracle where a tumor just disappeared. It was a nightmare to handle, and a full on BAMBOOZLEMENT to process.

I have the appointment in May where I'll get my answer one way or another. It's just frustrating to not 'know'. To have the glimmer of 'oh shit, maybe not', that you have to quash down really quickly because you don't want to get your hopes up. To pick at old scabs and find they won't heal. To not be able to talk about it with your friends, because then THEY start hoping and wishing you the best and you have to quash THOSE good vibes.

Just once, give me a straight answer, doctors/universe/karma/fate. Once.",Rant,False

I’ve been offered a new pump since my current one has so many issues. My current one is tubeless and I haven’t had that many issues with it, I can sauna with it etc. 

But now that I’ve been offered a new pump, I have to make the choice between tube or not. 

The reason I didn’t opt in for a tube pump the first time around was because I thought I would go insane sleeping with it (I already have a bunch of issues with falling asleep) 
But I’ve started living a much more active life now, I bathe on the beach weekly, sauna and a bunch of other stuff, and the thought of being able to just detach your pump for 15 minutes sounds awesome, so I’m really split on this.

Being consistent is tiring. Developing a routine is hard for me cuz I’m a person that hates repetition, whether it be for workouts, dieting, hygiene, etc. I know I can switch things up on a daily basis to keep a routine more lively, but I still end up getting tired of the routine. My inability to maintain consistency is my biggest setback when it comes to me bettering my health, and I imagine others have struggled with it before. I just want some tips on how to make a routine more tolerable or enjoyable, or how to get over myself and just push through it.

I know therapy would help a lot with developing better habits, but I currently can’t afford to go on a regular basis so that’s out of the question lol",Discussion,False
