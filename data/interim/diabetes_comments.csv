A patent lasts for 20 years. Of those 20 years, it takes, on average, 13-14 years to get a drug to market from when it's first discovered. That leaves 6-7 years of patent life before the patent runs out and the generics hit the market.m So, you have 6-7 years to make back your R&D costs AND turn a profit.

And, as soon as you release a drug, all the generic drug makers have bought it and are actively reverse engineering it. So, the FIRST DAY your patent expires, not only do drug stores already have the generics in stock, but it takes an act of God to get your insurance company to pay for a name brand drug.

So, the day after your patent expires, your profits from a drug can drop as much as 90%.

Drug companies do the math and charge appropriately. If you put a price cap on what they can charge for a diabetic medication, then they'll just stop doing the research on diabetes.

You want cheap diabetic medication, then perhaps a nonprofit like the ADA should find research and then hold patents. But of course if they did that, then they'd lose all those donations they're getting from the pharmaceutical industry.

Doofus, private industry fucks up ALL THE TIME. 90% of businesses that ever existed fail, go BK, get taken over either by another company, or get bailed out by...wait for it...the government. Governments don't have the luxury of going BK and sprouting up elsewhere. So whatever failures that happen in the public sector get pinned on the same entity. Name any failure of the US government, and I'll name 100x more failures by the private sector. For an entity that has existed 248 years, the US federal government has considerable more successes than failures. 

It's hilarious that you're holding up the private sector in healthcare as some sort of paragon of success. Healthcare is the biggest clusterfuck out of any private business sector business.

I guess you're unfamiliar with GLP and GMP requirements that the government has imposed on pharmaceutical companies, which further increase drug development and drug manufacturing costs.

I'm not saying the private sector is perfect, but it does a hell of a lot better job than the government can. If the government owned insulin production and distribution, we'd all still be injecting ourselves with pig or cow insulin.

The tweet he is referring to never mentioned it was _discovered_ in 1923, it said _(ACCURATELY)_ that the inventors patented the process of that type of insulin and sold it for 1$ in 1923 - [because it was indeed patented in 1923](https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AQ10017) and sold that same year on January 23rd 1923 _(for extra accuracy, it was filed on January 12th, Sold for 1$ on Jan 23rd, and the patent itself was granted on October 1923)_

&nbsp;

And I can guarantee you it is _still_ not the same as the ''25$ insulin'' Musk is referring to, because that patent is related to the **fish glands extraction technique.**

Musk is trying to sound intelligent and aware but he ends up proving he knows next to nothing on the topic and couldn't understand the original tweet nor adequately reply to it. He misunderstood the parent tweet and came up with a condescending and inaccurate tweet. Brilliant.

But this transplant is only performed in very extreme cases because of the risks and the high chance of the body rejecting the transplant and also then you still need to take immunosuppressants for the rest of your life to avoid the body rejecting the transplant (which could still happen nontheless).

At the county or state level, it's a lot more representative.  But at the federal level, everything is gerrymandered and lobbied to such an extent that the average person can't do anything and isn't really represented.  The rates at which incumbents in Congress are re-elected would likely be considered proof of election fraud in other democratic countries.   In my state, for instance, every time there is a new Congressional election the incumbent Republican will win 100% of the time.  If another Republican wins, it's because the incumbent retired.    It's not a democratic system, it's an aristocracy with the illusion of democratic processes.

&#x200B;

On top of that, our society is segmented even more at lower levels.   Type 1 diabetics make up a very small part of the population.   Among the sickest people in our society, children are very often covered by parent's insurance or an assistance program.   The elderly get medicare and probably a supplemental insurance policy.   But if you're between the ages 25-69, and you have a chronic health problem, your freedom is basically gone.  You'll spend your life working for health insurance just to pay thousands of dollars in deductibles, and pay thousands more each year as the prices rise faster than income.

&#x200B;

And if you ever get too sick to keep your job (which you will eventually as a type 1), you lose your health insurance.  And you might get disability, if you're lucky, after a few years.  And even then it won't cover the things health insurance would.   If you're lucky enough to have family that cares, they may keep you alive at great expense to themselves.    But once your usefulness to the private sector has ended, your ability to manage health conditions becomes exponentially more difficult.

&#x200B;

So the reason we aren't marching in the streets is that those of us who should are either too sick or too busy to do it.  The rest of us don't see that there is a problem, so aren't motivated to do anything about it.   And the government doesn't have to care in any event, because they know they'll keep their jobs whether we die or not.

Insulin is an anabolic hormone which breaks down glucose (sugar) and stores it as fat; meaning insulin leads to weight gain and increased body fat. Yet, the public is convinced that insulin is needed to treat “chronic” type 2 diabetes. The OP thinks that price ceilings mandated through government intervention into artificially selected markets/sectors in attempt to reduce costs. I’m simply saying that price controls have never worked nor will they ever work. We think that mandating a minimum wage somehow benefits low-income workers, but all it does is prevent low-skilled people from ever obtaining work preventing them from obtaining skills and ever rise out of the current economic situation they are in. Minimum wage laws also create a surplus of unemployed people looking for work. In blue cities across the US, liberal politicians mandate rent-controls on rental property as a means of combatting rising rent. This price control leads to lower quality housing, increased black market activity, and a surplus of people looking for housing. The point being: market intrusion/intervention by government, no matter how well intended the actions are, always lead to negative, unintended consequences.

#Article paraphrased:  
  
Walmart Insulin (Novalin N, based on 1950's tech) saves money today, but can result in higher costs and poorer health in the long run. These insulins are not the answer to the rapid rise in prices for more popular insulins (based on 1982 tech).  

The old insulin doesn't work quickly. It requires a difficult schedule to maintain.

Now if you go to high in an airplane, you’ll run out of oxygen, but it will take sometime for it to be really bad, unless you go really high.  If you go too low in the plane, especially too quickly, you’ll crash right away and it’s catastrophic.  You want the plane at just the right height, which is hard, but better to be too high in a plane for a little bit, than to be too low and crash the plane. 

If we don’t give enough insulin before a meal and he is too high, it’s easy to give him a little bit more an hour later.
