Diagnosed for 15 years. I‚Äôve never taken care of myself properly because I was mentally unwell and had a phobia of needles. I didn‚Äôt see the effects instantly or I thought ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a problem when I‚Äôm old‚Äù therefore I didn‚Äôt care. 

I‚Äôve been in KDA, I‚Äôve gone months without insulin, I‚Äôve gone a few periods that were okay but for the most part, completely irresponsible. 

It‚Äôs only now that my HBA1C levels are in normal range. I‚Äôve never had that in my life. I managed to go from 14+ (they think in the 20s but it doesn‚Äôt give you a number past 14) to 6 in the space of 3 months. Pretty extreme but I did it. 

I turned my HBA1C around pretty much ‚Äúovernight‚Äù. I finally accepted this disease and working on my mental health. I am attending all my appointments and doing my part. 


But the damage is done. 

I am going blind. I need to travel overseas every few weeks to get laser treatment and eye injections for the foreseeable future. 

My pulse is extremely low in my legs and blood flow to the point I‚Äôm always cold or can‚Äôt walk long. 

I am in kidney failure beyond repair and the next stage is an organ transplant (if I even get one). 


Please learn from me. Be kind to yourself. That‚Äôs all.


I am thinking of writing a book to share my journey and how I got to this point and what life is like now. Maybe a wake up call for some, or just a hard lesson that can‚Äôt be reversed. Thank you all for your kind words and please take care of yourselves. I believe in all of you.",Type 1,FALSE
